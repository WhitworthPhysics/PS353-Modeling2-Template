# PS353 Modeling 2

There are two modeling exercises to be completed in this session.

# Part A: Pendulum Motion with Quadratic Drag
You will be led through how we can fit a numeric model (one that can't be expressed as a function) to data using the Nelder-Mead algorithm.

# Part B: Rocket Motion with Quadratic Drag
You will then demonstrate your ability to perform this type of fit for the case of a model rocket subject to quadratic drag.
